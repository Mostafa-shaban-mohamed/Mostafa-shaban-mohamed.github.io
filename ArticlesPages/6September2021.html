            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              There are two implementation of .NET platform for building Web applications:
              <ul>
                <li>.NET Framework (.NET 4.8)</li>
                <li>.NET Core (.NET 5+)</li>
              </ul>
              They may be share the same components and codes, but there are different from each other in configuration,
              operating systems and more fundamental staff that we will explain some of them in this article.
              It is your choice to decide which one of them is suitable for your apps and projects.
            </p>
            <h4>.NET Framework:</h4>
            <p>
              It is framework that supports only windows operating system and any application that runs on it.
              It supports building apps using Windows Forms,
              WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation is a UI framework that creates desktop client applications.)
              and UWP (Universal Windows Platform provides a common app platform on every device that runs Windows 10).
            </p>
            <h4>.NET Core:</h4>
            <p>
              It is new open source and cross-platform framework to build and run applications for all operating systems (Windows, Linux and Mac).
              There are versions of UWP and ASP.NET in core called UWP Core API and ASP.NET Core respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              Still yet, you probably don’t know when to choose .NET core or .NET framework.
              We will help with this by showing pros and cons of each and conditions to choose each of them,
              but you will be the one who takes the final decision.
            </p>
            <h3>Developers choose .NET Framework When ....</h3>
            <h4>Current .NET Framework applications:</h4>
            <p>
              Before you jump to migrating a current .NET framework applications
              to .NET core, here is a better approach, you can you .NET core in
              the extension of this application if there is any additional features needed,
              but except that don’t migrate the application to .NET core.
              The thing about .NET Core that it is a higher version of framework which means
               it supports the older versions and can adapt to them.
            </p>
            <h4> Third party libraries or technologies that doesn’t support .NET Core 5:</h4>
            <p>
              As .NET Core is the new version, every library tries to have a Core
              version such as Entity framework Core & UWP Core. But yet, there still
               a lot of work needed to move all .NET framework libraries to .Net Core.
               And even after release of Core version their still some issues to be
               handled like that in Entity framework Core.
            </p>
            <h4>Use some Platforms that doesn’t support .NET Core 5:</h4>
            <p>
              Some Azure Services doesn’t support .NET Core yet,
              it is planned to in later versions (.NET Core 6+)
              but not at the moment. So it is a smart decision to use
              .NET framework.
            </p>
            <h4>Want to use some technologies not available in .NET Core 5:</h4>
            <p>
              ASP.NET Core can’t be used for ASP.NET Web Forms, Web Pages, WF and even F# and VB are not supported in all projects templates of .NET Core.
              Simply, .NET Framework is better if:
              <ul>
                <li>You don’t have time to learn new technology.</li>
                <li>Need stable and well supported environment to work.</li>
                <li>Don’t want to upgrade or migrate to new system or environment.</li>
                <li>Build windows client applications using Windows Form or WPF.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Developers choose .NET Core 5 when ....</h3>
            <h4>Cross-platform is needed:</h4>
            <p>
              One of my favourite feature in .NET Core 5 is the ability
              to build and run on any operating syste, which doesn’t make
              it tied to windows and Microsoft only. It will help it
              spread in development world faster. Microsoft tools such
              as Visual Studio Code is also cross-platform tool which make
              it even better and easier to develop in non-windows environment.
            </p>
            <h4>Microservices architecture is used:</h4>
            <p>
              Simply, Microservices is a service that allows multiple of services
              to run individually but still connected to each other. Microsoft knew
               this will be the future because of multiple benefits for
               enterprises and developers, that’s why .NET core 5+ supports this
               services and supports its technologies and tools such
               as Azure Services Fabrics and Azure App Services.
            </p>
            <h4>Docker containers are used:</h4>
            <p>
              Containers are used in presence of Microservices architecture.
              .Net framework can use Windows containers, but if you want a
              light-weight and modular service then .NET Core is a better choice,
              because it’s cross-platform. You can deploy server apps to
              Linux Docker containers on Azure Kubernetes Services which can manage
              and scale container–based apps on Azure Cloud.
            </p>
            <h4>High performance and Scalable systems are required:</h4>
            <p>
              As we said earlier, .NET Core 5+ is cross-platform and
              light-weighted framework, which makes it the best choice for
              applications that requires high performance and scalability. A
              lower number of servers and virtual machines are required when using
              .NET Core. Plus as mentioned before, it is better choice for
              Microservices and Containers.
            </p>
            <h3>Upcoming Ship Dates for .NET Core:</h3>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>.NET Core 3.1x (servicing): LTS (Long Term Support) release. Approximately every 1-2 months or as needed.</li>
                <li>.NET 5.0 (servicing): Current release. Approximately every 1-2 months or as needed.</li>
                <li>.NET 6.0: LTS (Long Term Support) release, scheduled for November 2021.</li>
                <li>.NET 7.0: Release scheduled for November 2022.</li>
                <li>.NET 8.0: LTS (Long Term Support) release, scheduled for November 2023.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
              The debate on .NET Core and .NET Framework shows the differences
              between the two platforms. But we are not here to tell you which
              is better for you, this choice is for you to decide. Both platforms
              still available and there are a lot of tutorials, courses and project
              online free and paid.
            </p>
            <p>
              .NET framework will have no further new versions,
              while .NET Core will. On the other hand, .NET Core is still
              new and will probably have a lot of issues, fixes and updates,
              while .NET Framework is well grown and widely used in software
              development world. But evaluation is coming whether we like it or
              not. But it doesn’t mean .Net Framework will extinct, not even soon.
              The choice is yours.

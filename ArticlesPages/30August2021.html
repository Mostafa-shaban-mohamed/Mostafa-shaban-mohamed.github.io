            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>In the world of web development,
              there are many frameworks and languages used to build web applications.
              Each of those frameworks have features and requirements of software tools and IDEs.
              In this article, we will discuss ASP.NET and how to be ASP.NET web developer.
            </p>
            <h3>What is .NET</h3>
            <p>
              First of all, before we talk about ASP.NET.
              We need to know what is (.NET) in ASP.NET actually is. Dot net or (.NET)
              is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications
              such as web apps, mobile apps, desktop apps, games, and IoT.
            </p>
            <p>
              In simpler words, it is a tool which helps you build and run multiple languages (C#, F#, VB) programs.
              Dot net platform has tools to translate your code into instructions that computer or server can use,
              provide utilities for building software such as tools to render text to screen or find current time,
              help storing information by defining data types for developers.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are two types of dot net platforms:
              <ul>
                <li>Dot net framework is originally built for windows operating systems only (run and build apps on windows OS only).</li>
                <li>Dot net Core is cross-platform version of dot net framework because it’s more flexible and lighter version of dot net framework (run and build apps on all OS).</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>What is ASP.NET</h3>
            <p>
              Now after we understand what is dot net is,
              let us continue with ASP.NET.
              Formally, ASP.NET extends the .NET platform with tools and libraries specifically for building web apps.
              Informally, if we want to build programs specifically for web such as websites,
              we will need to add tools on top of dot net platform which called ASP.NET.
            </p>
            <p>
              These are some things that ASP.NET adds to the .NET platform:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Base framework for processing web requests in C# or F#</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Web-page templating syntax</strong>, known as Razor, for building dynamic web pages using C#</li>
                <li><strong>Libraries for common web patterns</strong>, such as Model View Controller (MVC)</li>
                <li><strong>Authentication system</strong> that includes libraries, a database, and template pages for handling logins, including multi-factor authentication and external authentication with Google, Twitter, and more.</li>
                <li><strong>Editor extensions</strong> to provide syntax highlighting, code completion, and other functionality specifically for developing web pages</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Required Skills to be ASP.NET Web Developer:</h3>
            <p>
              Like any new skill, it takes time and practice to be good at this.
              You have to study hard and smart to be efficient at what you do.
              There are many steps to be ASP.NET developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>General Development Skills</strong>,
              you can’t be a web developer of any framework or tools if you don’t know about some essential skills
              such as GIT (Version Control), HTTP/HTTPs protocol and Data Structure & Algorithms.
              Those are extremely important skills that are must-known by any web developer no matter which tool or
              framework is used. They will help so much in upcoming skills and tools.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Programming Language</strong>,
              you can’t code without a programming language,
              for this it is C#. Of course there are other languages which can be used in ASP.NET
              such as F# and VB.NET. But C# is the most common and easiest to learn
              and also is most popular among developers all over the world.
              Plus learn about dot net 5 which is the newest version of
              dot net platform (at the time this article is written).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>SQL Fundamentals</strong>, if we are talking about web development we have to talk about databases and how to manage them in order to fetch data out or push data in of database. Microsoft has managed its own solution about that which is T-SQL, it is like SQL but with simple modifications to adjust with other Microsoft products (SQL Server). You have to learn about database design and SQL syntax. Constraints and Triggers also need to be understood for creating and managing databases for web applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>ASP.NET Core &/or Framework Basics</strong>, now we start to go deeper for more interesting stuff. After learning the fundamentals, we start to explore about ASP.NET and as it was explained above, there is difference between ASP.NET Core and Framework and this difference affects code written and how it is written, the design pattern used and a lot of technical stuff. So here you have a heavy chose to take “<i>Which one should I learn or should I go for both at the same time</i>”. Well this one is totally yours. If you want my recommendation don’t go for both at the same time, it will confuse you and it’s already time consuming to learn on of them what about the both at the same time. But know this if you understood one of them it will help you understand the other. It is the same concept but different execution due to the change of OS on server and cross-platform concept. Some of principles are common in both such as MVC, REST API, Razor pages, Filters & Attributes and Authentication & Authorization. Those are extremely important and must know principles if you want to be a great ASP.NET developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>SOLID Principle</strong>, SOLID is a basic design principle which help solve most common problems developers find when working on their projects. It stands for five principle, Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), Open-Closed Principle (OCP), Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). By studying each one of them you will have strong well-designed code.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Entity Framework</strong>, now you have database and user interface which collect information or display them but how to link between them, how to map the information coming to the right table and database in backend code. The part responsible on this is called Object-Relational Mapping (ORM). In ASP.NET, we used ORM called Entity Framework which do this part. There is ASP.NET Core version of it called Entity Framework Core. What you need to learn about is the basics of Entity Framework, Code First & Migrations, Change Tracker API, types of loading such as lazy loading & explicit loading. This skill will help make your code run faster which eventually will make web application load and run faster and this was a game changer for some business.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Dependency Injection</strong>, this is a big deal if you chose to learn ASP.NET Core. It is design pattern used in most of code in ASP.NET Core. It is simply help make your backend code independent from database or object referred in controller. So if there is any changes happened in database or tables, you don’t need to change the whole code or make any big changes in your backend code. You have to focus on DI Containers (simply a framework to create dependencies and inject them automatically when required) and Life Cycles (Scoped, Transient & Singleton).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Databases</strong>, at this point you learned the fundamentals of SQL and learned few things about designing databases may be even created and managed some databases. May even learned that there are many types of databases such as Relational Databases (SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL), Cloud Databases (Azure CosmosDB, Amazon DynamoDB), NoSQL (MongoDB, LiteDB, Redis). You don’t need to learn about each on of them but simply learn about those you use the most in your work and project and try to get some knowledge about others either by reading articles about them or reading their documentation or have conversation with someone who specialized in them.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Caching</strong>, one of advanced skills is to manage caching and knowing the difference between Memory Cache and Distributed Cache and how to use each. This skill is advanced and complicated one but it will have a huge impact on your code and how your web application is running.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>API Clients & Communication</strong>, API (Application Programming Interface) is great topic in web development. It is necessary for any web developer which you already should have some background knowledge about when you learn about fundamentals of ASP.NET. But here you will dig deeper in this topic. Learn more about REST and SOAP and differences between them, methods (PUT, POST, DELETE, GET) and explore other alternatives such as GraphQL.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Design Pattern</strong>, it is a way to organize your code to prevent a common problems happen in development process. It has a huge impact on your code and web application is you done it right. It solves a common problems in software development environment that most developer neglect. It is extremely underrated skill that is needed in web application. There are more than 23 design pattern in software development, it will be very useful to know all of them but it will be time consuming and hard to study and memorize all of them, so these are the recommended ones: CQRS, Singleton, Decorator, Abstract method, Builder, Strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Testing</strong>, testing is simply investigation of your code to measure the quality and effectiveness of the software or code. To see the full capacity and test the extreme measures to know its response on software. It is even has its own title and hierarchy. As ASP.NET developer, you must be able to run test on your own code and understand the results. You must learn the types of testing such as Unit testing (most common and must-learn) (Framework, Mocking, Assertion), integration testing, behavior testing and E2E testing.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Real-Time Communication</strong>, if you are going to be ASP.NET web developer, you are going to build a real-time web application such as chat web application or finical web application. So you need to learn about SignalR (most common) and web sockets. They are basically a computer communication protocols over the internet and both are supported by dot net 5.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Microservices</strong>, IBM defines Microservices as “<i>Microservices architecture is an approach in which a single application is composed of many loosely coupled and independently deployable smaller services.</i>” Simply as solution of business to have a rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. It is a huge topic on its own but it is necessary for survival of business in modern fast development of both software and hardware. You need to learn about Message-Broker (RabbitMQ), Message-Bus (MassTransit), API Gateway (Ocelot), Containerization (Docker), Orchestration (Kubernetes).
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, this is not all of it. There are still a lot of things to learn such as Client-side libraries (Blazor) and Task Scheduling. But those are essential skills to be ASP.NET Web Developer. Put in consideration that we only discussed the backend (server side) part of ASP.NET web developer, because the frontend (client side) part is independent of backend meaning you can choose whatever frontend framework to use it will not affect your backend code or chooses in design pattern and code architecture. Plus HTML & CSS are in every frontend code whatever frontend framework used.
            </p>
            <p>
              Quick advice for the beginners who read this and think it is too many skills and it will take too much time. Some of those skills will take long time to master while others will take short time and less effort. So don’t worry about it and as long as it is fun for you (which it will), it will be easy as well.
            </p>
            <h3>Software tools and environment needed to start:</h3>
            <p>
              By now, you want to get your hands dirty with the work. To start you have to setup some tools to be able to code and see the results. We will mention the important software tools and useful links to download and setup on your device. They will take time to be ready on your device.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=16"><strong>Visual studio 2019</strong></a>, there are to versions of it, visual studio IDE and visual studio code. VS Code is lighter version and it will required from you to setup the C# runtime and CLI by yourself. But in this article we recommend to use visual studio IDE community edition to make your life easier.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15"><strong>SQL Server Management Studio 18.9.x</strong></a>, SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is an integrated environment for managing any SQL infrastructure, from SQL Server to Azure SQL Database. SSMS provides tools to configure, monitor, and administer instances of SQL Server and databases. Use SSMS to deploy, monitor, and upgrade the data-tier components used by your applications, and build queries and scripts.
            </p>
            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
            <p>
              In summary, Being ASP.NET Developer is decision. But to become a reality it needs work and study and practice to follow this decision. Once you create your first real web application, you will start to feel the real potential behind it. Whether you chose this field for the money or the fun, you will see the outcome if you put enough work.
